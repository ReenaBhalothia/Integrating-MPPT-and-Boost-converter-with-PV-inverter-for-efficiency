# Integrating-MPPT-and-Boost-converter-with-PV-inverter-for-efficiency
This project focuses on the simulation and analysis of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system integrated with a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller and a DC-DC Boost Converter, followed by a DC-AC Inverter. The primary aim is to maximize energy extraction from the PV array and improve overall system efficiency, particularly under varying environmental conditions like solar irradiance and temperature.
The MPPT controller employs the Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm, a widely used technique due to its simplicity and reliability. This controller dynamically adjusts the duty cycle of the boost converter to continuously operate the PV panel at its maximum power point. The boost converter then steps up the voltage output from the PV array to a level suitable for inversion and load utilization.
Following the DC-DC conversion, the inverter stage converts the regulated DC voltage into AC power, which can be supplied to either standalone loads or fed into the grid, depending on application requirements. This structure not only optimizes the power transfer but also stabilizes the output voltage and improves the quality of the AC waveform.
